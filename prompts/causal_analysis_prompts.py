You are a expert data analyst for causal inference.

Given a natural language question, table descriptions and an expression_dict, extract:

- treatment: variable being manipulated
- outcome: variable being affected
- treatment_expression / outcome_expression: SQL expression to compute the variable (may include CASE WHEN, math functions, etc.)
- confounders: control variables for backdoor adjustment
- confounder_expressions: SQL expressions for each confounder (same order)
- mediators: optional variables on the causal path
- instrumental_variables: optional IVs

# Rules:
- Use only columns or derivable expressions from the schema.
- Do NOT use identifiers like *_id or primary keys as variables.
- If a variable (e.g., age) needs to be derived, define an alias (e.g., "age") and include its SQL expression in confounder_expressions.
- Expressions must match SQL syntax (e.g., CASE WHEN ..., DATE_PART(...), etc.)

### 2. SQL Generation Prompt
sql_generation_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """
You are a senior data analyst generating a PostgreSQL query for causal analysis. Decompose the task into subtasks to generate a final SQL query.
     
You will be given:
- A list of variable names that appear in the causal graph with a mapping to its SQL expression. Every variable **must** be selected in the final query **only** using its corresponding SQL expression. Do not use other expressions, even if they are semantically equivalent.
- Table Schema Information.

## Instructions:
Decompose the task into:
1.	For each variable, check if the expression can be computed directly from the available tables by a simple join (and, if necessary, GROUP BY or aggregate). If so, compute it directly in the final_table CTE and do not create a separate CTE for this variable.
2.  If a variable cannot be computed directly from the available tables and requires a non-trivial subquery, repeated logic, or pre-aggregation that cannot be handled directly in final_table create a CTE for that variable. If multiple variables share the same SQL expression, they can be selected together in the same CTE/subquery. 
3.	In final_table, join all necessary tables and CTEs and select all variables. The order in which you join tables in the final_table should always respect the foreign key (FK) relationships specified in the schema.
4.	The final query must always be SELECT * FROM final_table;.

## Rules:
- Do not include explanatory text
- NEVER assume any relationships not explicitly stated as foreign keys. When joining CTEs or tables, use only the foreign key relationships defined in the schema. Do not calculate a new varaible to join tables.
- Do not alias tables (e.g., avoid `FROM users u`)
- Do not include GROUP BY or ORDER BY unless needed
- NEVER write expressions like `(SELECT ... WHERE ... = outer_column LIMIT 1)`, as they will result in 'correlated subquery' errors in PostgreSQL.
- Always output the final SQL query as a code block with ```sql ```.

## Example1:
Variables:
- cart_item_id
- campaign_exposed
- cart_total_value

Variable to SQL expression mapping:
- cart_item_id: cart_items.cart_item_id
- campaign_exposed: CASE WHEN COUNT(campaign_exposure.exposure_id) > 0 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END
- cart_total_value: SUM(cart_items.price * cart_items.quantity)

Schema:
TABLE: carts
  COLUMNS: cart_id (uuid), customer_id (uuid), created_at (date)
TABLE: cart_items
  COLUMNS: cart_item_id (uuid), cart_id (uuid), product_id (uuid), price (numeric), quantity (integer)
TABLE: campaign_exposure
  COLUMNS: exposure_id (uuid), cart_id (uuid), campaign_id (uuid)
TABLE: campaigns

FOREIGN KEYS:
  carts.cart_id -> cart_items.cart_id
  carts.cart_id -> campaign_exposure.cart_id
  campaign_exposure.campaign_id -> campaigns.campaign_id

Output:
```sql

### 3. review SQL Prompt
sql_review_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """
You are a senior data analyst reviewing a PostgreSQL query for causal analysis.
     
You will be given:
1. A SQL query that selects data for causal analysis
2. A list of variable names that must be selected in the query and their corresponding SQL expressions.
3. Table schemas

## instructions:   
You task is to check if the SQL query meets the following requirements:
    1. The query must select all variables listed in 【Variables】. Also, you must check that each variable is selected using **exactly** the SQL expression provided in 【Variable SQL Expressions】. However, it is allowed for the required SQL expression to appear in a CTE (Common Table Expression) or subquery, as long as the final output selects the variable using the correct alias that refers to the CTE/subquery result.
    - If the same variable name appears multiple times in the SELECT clause, keep only the one that uses the exact required SQL expression, and remove all others. Update the JOIN conditions if needed.
    2. The query should only use JOINs based on explicit foreign key (FK) relationships as defined in the table schemas. If any JOINs are not based on an FK relationship, modify the query to use the correct FK-based JOIN instead.
     - When fixing Joins, consider the order of joins in the FROM clause. The order should respect the foreign key (FK) relationships specified in the schema.
    3. If sql needs to be fixed, output the revised SQL query in a code block with ```sql ```.

## Rules:
- When revising the query, you must preserve the original overall structure as much as possible (including CTEs, JOINs, and the general flow). Only add or modify specific parts as needed to satisfy the requirements. Do not rewrite the entire query from scratch.
- If the same variable name appears multiple times in the SELECT clause, keep only the one that uses the exact required SQL expression, and remove all others. Update the JOIN conditions if needed.
- Don't include variables other than those listed in 【Variables】. But you must ensure that all variables in 【Variables】 are selected in the final query using the SQL Expressions.
- Never select the same variable multiple times in the final query.  
     
## Example1:
【Variables】
- cart_item_id
- campaign_exposed
- cart_total_value

【Variable SQL Expressions】
- cart_item_id: cart_items.cart_item_id
- campaign_exposed: CASE WHEN COUNT(campaign_exposure.exposure_id) > 0 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END
- cart_total_value: SUM(cart_items.price * cart_items.quantity)

【Schema】
TABLE: carts
  COLUMNS: cart_id (uuid), customer_id (uuid), created_at (date)
TABLE: cart_items
  COLUMNS: cart_item_id (uuid), cart_id (uuid), product_id (uuid), price (numeric), quantity (integer)
TABLE: campaign_exposure
  COLUMNS: exposure_id (uuid), cart_id (uuid), campaign_id (uuid)
TABLE: campaigns
  COLUMNS: campaign_id (uuid), name (text), start_date (date), end_date (date)

FOREIGN KEYS:
  carts.cart_id -> cart_items.cart_id
  carts.cart_id -> campaign_exposure.cart_id
  campaign_exposure.campaign_id -> campaigns.campaign_id

【SQL GENERATED】
```sql
WITH
campaign_exposed_per_cart AS (
    SELECT
        cart_id,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(exposure_id) > 0 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS campaign_exposed
    FROM campaign_exposure
    GROUP BY cart_id
),
final_table AS (
    SELECT
        cart_items.cart_item_id AS cart_item_id,
        SUM(cart_items.price * cart_items.quantity) AS cart_total_value
        campaign_exposed_per_cart.campaign_exposed AS campaign_exposed
    FROM cart_items 
    LEFT JOIN campaign_exposed_per_cart ON cart_items.cart_id = campaign_exposed_per_cart.cart_id
)
SELECT * FROM final_table;
```
【Output】
Step 1: cart_item_id, campaign_exposed, cart_total_value are all selected correctly using their corresponding SQL expressions.
Step 2: All joins are correct.
Step 3: The final query is valid and selects all required variables.
     
## Example2:
【Variables】
- student_id
- course_name
- professor_name
     
【Variable SQL Expressions】
- student_id: students.student_id
- course_name: courses.course_name
- professor_name: professors.name

【Schema】     
TABLE: students
  COLUMNS: student_id (uuid), name (text), birth_year (integer)
TABLE: enrollments
  COLUMNS: enrollment_id (uuid), student_id (uuid), course_id (uuid), enrolled_at (date)
TABLE: courses
  COLUMNS: course_id (uuid), course_name (text), professor_id (uuid)
TABLE: professors
  COLUMNS: professor_id (uuid), name (text)

FOREIGN KEYS:
  enrollments.student_id -> students.student_id
  enrollments.course_id -> courses.course_id
  courses.professor_id -> professors.professor_id
     
【SQL GENERATED】
```sql
WITH final_table as (
    SELECT
    students.student_id AS student_id,

    professors.name AS professor_name
FROM students
JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.course_id 
JOIN professors ON courses.professor_id = professors.professor_id)
SELECT * FROM final_table;
```
【Output】
Step 1: student_id, course_name, professor_name are all selected correctly using their corresponding SQL expressions.
Step 2: The join between students and courses is incorrect. It should be based on enrollments table. 
Step 3: The revised query is:
```sql
WITH final_table AS (
    SELECT
    students.student_id AS student_id,
    courses.course_name AS course_name,
    professors.name AS professor_name
FROM enrollments
JOIN students ON enrollments.student_id = students.student_id
JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id
JOIN professors ON courses.professor_id = professors.professor_id)
SELECT * FROM final_table;
```

## Example3:
【Variables】
- customer_id
- name
- account_balance
- monthly_deposit_total

【Variable SQL Expressions】
- customer_id: customers.customer_id
- name: customers.name
- account_balance: accounts.balance
- monthly_deposit_total: SUM(CASE WHEN transactions.transaction_type = ‘deposit’
AND DATE_TRUNC(‘month’, transactions.transaction_date) = DATE_TRUNC(‘month’, CURRENT_DATE)
THEN transactions.transaction_amount ELSE 0 END)

【Schema】

FOREIGN KEYS:
accounts.customer_id -> customers.customer_id
transactions.account_id -> accounts.account_id
     
【SQL GENERATED】
```sql
WITH final_table AS (
    SELECT
    customers.customer_id AS customer_id,
    customers.name AS name,
    accounts.balance AS account_balance
FROM customers
JOIN accounts ON accounts.customer_id = customers.customer_id)
SELECT * FROM final_table;
```
【Output】
Step 1: customer_id, name, account_balance are selected correctly, but monthly_deposit_total is missing.
Step 2: The join between customers and accounts is correct, but transactions table is not included.
Step 3: The revised query is:
```sql
WITH monthly_deposits AS (
    SELECT
        accounts.customer_id,
        SUM(transactions.transaction_amount) AS monthly_deposit_total
    FROM accounts
    JOIN transactions ON transactions.account_id = accounts.account_id
    WHERE transactions.transaction_type = 'deposit'
      AND DATE_TRUNC('month', transactions.transaction_date) = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
    GROUP BY accounts.customer_id
),
WITH final_table as (
